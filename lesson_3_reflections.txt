When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is useful if you want to store information for use in more than one place.
It could also be useful for working with others from a long distance.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would want manual pulls because you might make small commits one at a time locally, which you wouldn't want people to see.
If your GitHub was automatic, these little changes would be seen before a change was completely added.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are useful when you want to create your own version of someone else's work. Clones are useful when you want to use the same work as someone else.
Branches are useful when you're making a large change to a master branch.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If any disastrous changes are pushed to GitHub, this state will be retrievable by the user.
