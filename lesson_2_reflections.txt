What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new repository is created in Git. You need to do it in order to store any files with git metadata.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is somewhat of a buffer between the directory and the repository. It allows users a greater amount of control.
Rather than committing only one thing at a time, many things can be committed in chunks as need be within the stagin area.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area lets you review your commit before you commit it. The user can also compare their staging area to the most recent commit.



What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches let you keep your original project intact, allowing you to see exactly where splits were made in the past.



How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams show the pathing for each branch and how they're related to the master branch as well as each other.



What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Two branches being merged together creates a seperate commit that combines the two branches using data from their most recent commits and the commit where they split.
It's represented in the diagram the way it is because it is a child of the two originally split branches.
